# weather-app
This Weather App lets you easily check the current weather of any city. Just search for a location to see details like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a short weather description. The app has a clean, modern design that works well on all devices. It uses a weather API to show real-time data and includes smooth animations and an easy-to-use layout. No backend is needed, making it a great example of using APIs and building a responsive, user-friendly frontend.
